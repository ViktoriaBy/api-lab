    "text": "-.-",
    "date": "26 Jan 2022"

6.What would the URL and body object be to update the post you just made to contain your faovrite color instead of your name?

9.What would cause a PUT request to return a 409 status?
	For example, if versioning were being used and the representation being PUT included changes to a 
	resource that conflict with those made by an earlier (third-party) request, the origin server might use a 409 response to indicate 
	that it can't complete the request. In this case, the response representation would likely contain information useful for 
	merging the differences based on the revision history.	

10.What happens if you try to send a query in the GET request URL? Why do you get that response?
